// Defines and registers a faithful native reimplementation that REPLACES the translated function
// at a PPC address (not a stub; genuine not-yet-implemented entries live in hle/gx/gx_fatal_stubs.cpp
// and abort). The translator regex-parses these macro names to skip that address at build time, so
// renaming requires updating Translator.Cli/Program.cs, RuntimeNativeGuestEffectAnalyzer.cs,
// TranslatedBuildShardEmitter.cs and RuntimeNativeFunctionAbiProvider.cs together.

//
// Each registers the native through NativeBindings::Resolve, which looks the
// address up in this game's own table by the address written here - the one the
// native was read from. A game that does not have that function, or in which it
// was never placed, binds nothing and runs its own translated code.
//
// Nothing defines `func_<address>`: that name means something only in the game
// the address came from, and in any other it is a different function that the
// translator has already emitted under the same name.
